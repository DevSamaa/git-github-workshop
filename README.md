| 3 | Find the command to jump into that folder/directory and create a new file called index.html
| 4 | Initialize git in that directory
| 5 | Drag and drop the HMTL file in your text/code editor (If you don't have one, download[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)). Then write some stuff in that file, close it and finally, save the file. How do you review what changed in the HTML file using git? Make a new commit to explain what changed.

**Before Getting started with the Challenges**

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | In your terminal, run the command: `git version`. If Git is not installed, you can find the install file [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
| 2 | To make your terminal more user-friendly, **install oh-my-zsh**
|   | **For Mac & Linux Users**: The installations instructions are [here](https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-zsh-and-oh-my-zsh-windows10/). You can also just run this command in your terminal: `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
|   |**b) For Windows 10 Users**: You can find installations instructions [here](https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-zsh-and-oh-my-zsh-windows10/), but the process is much much longer, so it is recommended that you do this at home.
