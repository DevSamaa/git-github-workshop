Make a new commit to explain what changed. (If you need to download a text Editor >> [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)). 
| 7 | Create a new branch and jump onto that branch. How do you know how many branches there are in the project? How do you know which branch you are on?
| 8 | Now, Git checkout to your master branch and then merge your branch to master branch

| Challenge2| Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Open your terminal.
| 2 | Make sure your current directory is on desktop.
| 3 | Go to https://github.com/allthatjoy/git-101-women-who-code

| 2 | This time, clone it directly
| 3 | Come and give us your Github Username so that I can add you as a collaborator
| 4 | Using a branch, add your name to the index.html file and push that branch to Github
| 5 | Open a Pull Request for us to review.
| 6 | If your Pull Request got accepted, your changes are added to the codebase and available [here](https://allthatjoy.github.io/git-101-women-who-code/)

**Before Getting started with the Challenges**

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | In your terminal, run the command: `git version`. If Git is not installed, you can find the install file [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
| 2 | To make your terminal more user-friendly, **install oh-my-zsh**
|   | **For Mac & Linux Users**: The installations instructions are [here](https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-zsh-and-oh-my-zsh-windows10/). You can also just run this command in your terminal: `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`
|   |**b) For Windows 10 Users**: You can find installations instructions [here](https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-zsh-and-oh-my-zsh-windows10/), but the process is much much longer, so it is recommended that you do this at home.
